# Using ActiveReportJS with node.js

This sample demonstrates how to use ActiveReportsJS with Node.js to generate a PDF report on the server side. 
The process involves running a headless browser, loading the page that hosts the ActiveReportsJS scripts, and executing the script that exports the report to PDF.

To run the code, enter the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Alternatively, if you are using `yarn`, enter the following commands:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

After running the code, you will find a `ProductsList.pdf` file in the root directory.
