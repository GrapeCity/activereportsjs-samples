# Using ActiveReportJS with node.js

This sample shows how to use ActiveReportsJS with node.js to export a report to PDF on the server-side.
The code runs the headless browser, loads the page that hosts ActiveReportsJS scripts, and executes the script that exports a report to PDF.

To run the code, execute the following commands.

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

or if you are using ```yarn```

```bash
yarn
node index.js
```

The code will create a ```ProductsList.pdf``` file in the root folder.
